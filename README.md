# CustomViewTest App
### An application that tests the creation of a Custom View and animation over elements of that View.

### Note: to try different animations, change the value of the "diagramFillingWay" attribute of StatsView in the activity_main.xml layout file to one of the following:
### 1) "parallel"
### 2) "sequential"
### 3) "bidirectional"
### 4) "rotation"
### e.g.:
``` 
<ru.company.customviewtest.StatsView
...
app:diagramFillingWay="rotation"
... />
```
